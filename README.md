## This is a Multivariate Calculus Demo I made for my project presentation, intented to show off the spherical coordinate system
If you click the green cube, a [0, 0, 4] vector and 4 cubes spawn.
The white cube enables the visibility of the sphere which bounds the vector.
The yellow cube starts the phi (3D) transformation animation.
The orange cube starts the theta (2D/Polar) transformation animation. If the orange is clicked first, nothing happens. This is intended behavior, as the vector is centered around the origin.
The pink cube starts both phi and theta transformation animations simultaneously.
Once yellow & orange or pink are pressed, a green reset cube appears to reset the plane, replacing the cubes including the white one if you pressed it.
